# Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing Using a Speedgoat Performance Machine
The files were written for completion of the hardware-in-the-loop testing for the PolySim ADCS lab thesis project. For the thesis, see the Cal Poly digital commons.

# Breakdown of the Files
Three test cases were created for the completion of this thesis project:
1. A simulation of the detumble phase of a satellite
2. A simulation of the disturbance forces acting on a satellite in LEO
3. A linear Kalman filter

Each test case has C++ code written for a Raspberry Pi and a Simulink model to perform the HIL tests. The detumble and disturbance tests, include a Simulink model that was used for validating the results of the HIL test.
There is documentation provided that explains how the code and Simulink models work, how to run a test, and a video showing how to run a test.
